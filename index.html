          <b>Gravitational Collapse of Self-Similar Stars</b><br/>
          The Euler-Poisson equations give the classical model of a
          self-gravitating star under Newtonian gravity. It is widely expected
          that, in certain regimes, initially smooth initial data may give rise
          to blow-up solutions, corresponding to the collapse of a star under
          its own gravity. In this talk, I will present recent work with Yan
          Guo, Mahir Hadzic and Juhi Jang that demonstrates the existence of
          smooth, radially symmetric, self-similar blow-up solutions for this
          problem. At the heart of the analysis is the presence of a sonic
          point, a singularity in the self-similar model that poses serious
          analytical challenges in the search for a smooth solution.

          <b>The Kawahara Equation</b><br/>
          The Kawahara equation is a 5th order dispersive equation, a
          higher order version of the KdV equation. Traveling waves satisfy
          a fourth-order ordinary differential equation in which the
          traveling wave speed \(c\) and a constant of integration \(A\) are
          parameters. A further integration yields the Hamiltonian, an
          invariant of all solutions. Periodic solutions are computed with
          an iterative spectral method, resulting in a family of periodic
          solutions depending on the three constants \(c\), \(A\) and wave number
          \(k\). We derive jump conditions between periodic solutions with
          different wave numbers but equal speeds and Hamiltonian. The jump
          conditions are necessary conditions for the existence of
          traveling waves that asymptote to the periodic orbits at
          infinity. Bifurcation theory and parameter continuation are then
          used to compute multiple solution branches for the jump
          conditions. From these, we construct heteroclinic orbits from the
          intersection of stable and unstable manifolds of compatible
          periodic solutions. Each branch terminates at an
          equilibrium-to-periodic solution in which the equilibrium is the
          background for a solitary wave that connects to the associated
          periodic solution. The jump conditions are closely related to
          Whitham shocks, discontinuous solutions of the Whitham modulation
          equations, suggesting the existence of wave structures more
          complex than the traveling waves presented here.

          <b>Stability of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum of weak turbulence</b></br>
          Weakly turbulent waves can be described by the kinetic wave
          equation. The first part of the talk will present results on the
          derivation of this effective equation from a microscopic system
          described by the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This kinetic wave
          equation has isotropic steady states called Kolmogorov–Zakharov
          spectra, that represent cascades of mass and energy between from
          small spatial scales toward large ones and conversely. The second
          part of the talk will discuss the stability of the spectrum
          associated to the indirect mass cascade. This is based on joint
          works with I. Ampatzoglou, H. Dietert, and P. Germain.

          In this talk, we will discuss some properties of traveling waves
          solutions for some variants of the classical Gross–Pitaevskii
          equation in the whole space, in order to include new physical models
          in Bose–Einstein condensates and nonlinear optics. We are interested
          in the existence of finite energy localized traveling waves solutions
          with nonvanishing conditions at infinity, i.e. dark solitons. After a
          review of the state of the art in the classical case, we will show
          some results for a family of Gross–Pitaevskii equations with nonlocal
          interactions in the potential energy, obtained by variational
          techniques. Then, we will discuss the existence and behavior of the
          dark solitons for the Gross–Pitaevskii equation is a strip, according
          to its width. This is joint work with Philippe Gravejat, Salvador
          Lopez-Martinez, and Didier Smets.

          We give an overview of recent developments in the stability study of
          nontrivial equilibria of the gravitational Vlasov–Poisson system. We
          discuss the existence of linear oscillating modes and the validity of
          the gravitational Landau damping in this context. Time permitting, we
          will also discuss the Einstein–Vlasov equilibria proving that steady
          galaxies with very dense cores lead to existence of growing mode
          instabilities in contrast to the Newtonian case. Our results
          highlight the importance of the Hamiltonian structure of these
          systems. The talk is based on published and ongoing works with Z.

          Smooth (spatially periodic) solutions to the incompressible 3D
          Euler equations have kinetic energy conservation in every local
          region, while turbulent flows exhibit anomalous dissipation of
          energy. Toward verification of the anomalous dissipation, the
          Onsager theorem, the threshold Hölder regularity of the total
          kinetic energy conservation is 1/3, has been proved by Isett. In
          this talk, I'll discuss a strong Onsager conjecture, which
          combines the Onsager theorem with the local energy inequality.

          <b>Boundary value problems for first-order elliptic operators with compact and noncompact boundary</b><br/>
          The index theorem for compact manifolds with boundary, established by
          Atiyah-Patodi-Singer in the mid-70s, is considered one of the most
          significant mathematical achievements of the 20th century. An
          important and curious fact is that local boundary conditions are
          topologically obstructed for index formulae and non-local  boundary
          conditions lie at the heart of this theorem. Consequently, this has
          inspired the study of boundary value problems for first-order
          elliptic differential operators by many different schools, with a
          class of induced  operators adapted to the boundary taking centre
          stage in formulating and understanding non-local boundary conditions.
          </p><p>
          That being said, much of this analysis has been confined to the
          situation when adapted boundary operators can be chosen self-adjoint.
          Dirac-type operators are the quintessential example. Nevertheless,
          natural geometric operators such as the Rarita-Schwinger operator on
          3/2-spiniors, arising from physics in the study of the so-called
          Delta baryon, falls outside of this class. Analytically, this
          requires analysis beyond self-adjoint operators. In recent work with
          Bär,  the compact boundary case is handled for general first-order
          elliptic operators, using spectral theory to choose adapted boundary
          operators to be invertible bi-sectorial. The Fourier circle methods
          present in the self-adjoint analysis are replaced by the  bounded
          holomorphic functional calculus, coupled with pseudo-differential
          operator theory and semi-group techniques. This allows for a full
          understanding of the maximal domain of the interior operator as a
          bounded surjection to a space on the boundary of mixed Sobolev
          regularity, constructed from spectral projectors associated to the
          adapted boundary operator. Regularity and Fredholm extensions are
          also studied.
          </p><p>
          For the noncompact case, a preliminary trace theorem as well as
          regularity theory are handed by resorting to the case with compact
          boundary. This necessitates  deforming the coefficients of the
          interior operator in a compact neighbourhood. Therefore, even for
          Dirac-type operators, allowing for fully general symbols in the
          compact boundary case is paramount. Under slightly stronger geometric
          assumptions near the noncompact boundary (automatic  for the compact
          case) and  when the interior operator admits a self-adjoint adapted
          boundary operator, an upgraded trace theorem mirroring the compact
          setting is obtained. Importantly, there is no spectral assumptions
          other than self-adjointness on the adapted boundary operator. This,
          in particular, means that the spectrum of this operator can be the
          entire real line. Again, the primarily tool that is used in the
          analysis is the bounded holomorphic functional calculus.

          <b>The role of boundary conditions in scaling laws for the Rayleigh–Bénard convection problem</b><br/>
          Rayleigh–Bénard convection is the buoyancy-driven flow of a fluid
          heated from below and cooled from above and is a paradigm for
          nonlinear dynamics with important applications in meteorology,
          oceanography and engineering. We are interested in obtaining
          quantitative bounds on the Nusselt number, the vertical heat
          transport enhancement factor. The Nusselt number, besides being an
          interesting quantity for engineering applications, is the natural
          quantity to measure the intensity and effectiveness of the motion.
          For this reason, we are interested in proving (upper) bounds which
          catch the relation between the Nusselt number and the (nondimensional
          control parameter) Rayleigh number, in turbulent regimes. Despite
          great scientific developments in this field in the last 30 years, it
          is still not clear what role the boundary conditions play in the
          scaling laws for the Nusselt number. In this talk we address this
          problem, establishing rigorous bounds for the Rayleigh–Bénard
          convection problem with Navier-slip boundary conditions for the
          velocity. We employ the background field method and deal with a
          careful PDE analysis, due to the production of vorticity at the
          walls. In conclusion, we relate this result to other bounds derived
          for no-slip and stress-free boundary conditions and discuss open
          problems. This seminar is based on a joint work with T. Drivas and H.
          Nguyen and on an ongoing project with F. Bleitner.
