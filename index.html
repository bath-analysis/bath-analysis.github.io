        <b>Weighted \(\infty\)-Willmore Spheres</b><br/>
         Consider the following problem: on the topological two-sphere \(S^2\),
         minimise a weighted version of the \(L^\infty\) norm of the mean
         curvature among all immersions \(f \colon S^2 \rightarrow
         \mathbb{R}^3\) with prescribed surface area.

         For this problem, we show under a low-energy assumption that not only
         minimisers but also a wider class of "pseudo-minimal" immersions are
         intimately connected to a system of PDEs, obtained as the limit as \(p
         \rightarrow \infty\) of the Euler-Lagrange equations for the
         approximating \(L^p\) problems. This system governs the geometry of our
         solutions, as its nodal set determines the mean curvature of the
         immersion. In particular, the mean curvature takes on at most three
         values: it vanishes on the nodal set, and elsewhere has constant
         magnitude with sign matching the sign of the PDEs' solution.

         Intriguingly, when attempting to solve the problem on surfaces other
         than the sphere we run into both energetic and analytical issues which
         prevent us from generalising our results further, although I am
         hopeful that some of these can be resolved by the time I finish my
         PhD!

         This is joint work with Roger Moser.

        <b>Concentrating solutions for the magnetic Ginzburg–Landau equations</b><br/>
        Given a closed manifold \(N\) and a compact, non-degenerate minimal
        submanifold \(M\) of codimension 2 we prove the existence of a collection
        of solutions \(U_\varepsilon\) to the magnetic Ginzburg–Landau equations
        such that \(U_\varepsilon\) concentrates around \(M\) as \(\varepsilon\to 0\).
        Moreover, we give a precise asymptotic expansion of the profile of this
        concentration and we show that the method we use can be extended to the
        non-compact case.

      <b>Some avatars of the correspondence principle in semi-classical analysis</b><br/>
      The correspondence principle, as stated by Niels Bohr in 1923, is at the
      root of the traditional results in semi-classical analysis. It offers a
      natural insight into the world of semi-classical pseudodifferential
      operators, Egorov Theorem, Wigner measures, etc… The aim of this talk
      will be to present this general setting and explain how recent results of
      semi-classical analysis express in that framework.

      <b>Quantitative estimates for almost harmonic maps</b><br/>
      For geometric variational problems one often only has weak, rather than strong,
      compactness results and hence has to deal with the problem that sequences of
      (almost) critical points \(u_j\) can converge to a limiting object with different
      topology. 
      A major challenge posed by such singular behaviour is that the seminal results
      of Simon on Lojasiewicz inequalities, which are one of the most powerful tools
      in the analysis of the energy spectrum of analytic energies and the
      corresponding gradient flows, are not applicable. 
      In this talk we present a method that allows us to prove Lojasiewicz
      inequalities for almost harmonic maps that form simple singularities and
      explain how these results allow us to draw new conclusions about the energy
      spectrum of harmonic maps and the convergence of harmonic map flow for low
      energy maps from surfaces into analytic manifolds.

      <b>Variations on Liouville's theorem</b><br/>
      A classical theorem of Liouville states that a function that is analytic
      and bounded on the entire complex plane is in fact constant. The same
      conclusion is true for a function that is harmonic and bounded on all of
      a Euclidean space. I will discuss generalisations of Liouville’s theorem
      to generators of Levy processes due to D. Berger, F. Kuehn, and R.L.
      Schilling, and will describe a related joint work in progress with D.

        <b>Infinite time blow-up for the 3D energy critical heat equation in bounded domains</b><br/>
        A typical positive solution to the Dirichlet problem for the
        energy-critical heat equation decays exponentially fast or blows up in
        finite time. Other behaviours have been known since 1984, but until
        2020 they have been precisely detected only in the radial case. In this
        talk, I will present the first examples of 3-dimensional non-radial
        global unbounded solutions, precisely describing asymptotic behaviour
        and stability. The dimension plays a crucial role, making the heart of
        the problem nonlocal, and revealing an interesting connection with the
        Brezis–Nirenberg number. This is joint work with Manuel del Pino.

      <b>The adjoint Rayleigh and Orr–Sommerfeld equations </b><br/>
        The Rayleigh and Orr–Sommerfeld equations are ODEs which arise from the
        linearised incompressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations around a
        shear flow. In this upcoming work joint with Jose Rodrigo, we consider
        the adjoints of the Rayleigh and Orr–Sommerfeld equations with respect
        to the complex \(L^2\) product. In the viscous case, we fix a family of
        viscosity-dependent Navier boundary conditions, which in the limit
        corresponds to the no-slip condition. We establish existence and
        asymptotic properties of their eigenvalues, eigenmodes and Green
        functions away from critical layers. An application of the adjoint
        operators is that they allow us to deduce properties of the kernels and
        images of the original operators in correspondence with their
        eigenvalues.

      <b>Transport of currents and geometric Rademacher-type theorems</b><br/>
      In the classical theory, given a vector field \(b\) on \(\mathbb R^d\), one
      usually studies the transport/continuity equation drifted by \(b\) looking
      for solutions in the class of functions (with certain integrability) or
      at most in the class of measures. In this seminar I will talk about
      recent efforts, motivated by the modelling of defects in crystals, aimed
      at extending the previous theory to the case when the unknown is instead
      a family of k-currents in \(\mathbb R^d\), i.e. generalised \(k\)-dimensional
      surfaces. The resulting equation involves the Lie derivative \(L_b\) of
      currents in direction \(b\) and reads \(\partial_t T_t + L_b T_t = 0\). In
      the first part of the talk I will briefly introduce this equation, with a
      special attention to its space-time formulation. I will then shift the
      focus to some rectifiability questions and Rademacher-type results: given
      a Lipschitz path of integral currents, I will discuss the existence of a
      “geometric derivative”, namely a vector field advecting the currents.
      Based on joint works with G. Del Nin (MPI, Leipzig) and F. Rindler
      (Warwick).

      We consider the viscous Burgers equation on the real line for a
      particular class of initial data with infinite mass. We show that the
      solutions decay at a better rate than the solutions of the heat equation
      for the same initial datas: a nonlinear transport term improves the
      dissipation. We compute the asymptotic profile, which presents a
      discontinuity, similar to boundary layer problems. This is a
      collaboration with Tej-Eddine Ghoul and Nader Masmoudi.

      <b>Schrödinger evolution in a low-density random potential – Convergence to solutions of the linear Boltzmann equation</b><br/>
      It is a fundamental problem in mathematical physics to derive macroscopic
      transport equation from the underlying microscopic transport equations.
      In this talk, we will consider problems of this kind. To be precise we
      will consider solutions to a time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a
      potential localised at the points of a Poisson point process. For these
      solutions we will present a result stating that the phase-space
      distribution converges in the annealed Boltzmann-Grad limit to a
      semiclassical Wigner measure which solves the linear Boltzmann equation.

      <b>Tetrahedral Frame Fields via Constrained Third-Order Symmetric Tensors</b></br>
      In this talk I will present some results on Ginzburg–Landau approximations of
      frame fields. Frame fields with octahedral order (cross fields) have been used
      for mesh generation, while tetrahedral symmetry occurs in some liquid crystals.
      Compared to their 2D analog (triangular or “Mercedes-Benz” frames), tetrahedral
      frames have a more interesting topology with non-abelian fundamental group.
      Tetrahedral frame fields have a natural isometric embedding into third-order
      symmetric tensors that allows a Ginzburg–Landau type approximation, and I will
      show some of the topological singularities than can be observed. This is joint
      work with Dmitry Golovaty, Alberto Montero and Daniel Spirn.

      <b>Mean Hadamard inequalities</b><br/>
      This talk is about integral functionals of the form
      \[I_n(\varphi)=\int_Q |\nabla \varphi|^n+ f(x)\det \nabla \varphi \;\mathrm dx\]
      which can appear in the Calculus of Variations as 'excess functionals'.  This
      makes it important to know for which \(f \in L^{\infty}(Q)\) it holds that
      \(I_n(\varphi) \geq 0\) for all \(\varphi \in W_0^{1,n}(Q;\mathbb{R}^n)\).  We
      prove that there are piecewise constant \(f\) such that \(I_n\geq 0\) holds and,
      moreover, that this is strictly stronger than any inequality obtained by
      using only the pointwise Hadamard inequality \(n^{\frac{n}{2}}|\det
      A|\leq |A|^n\) for \(n \times n\) matrices \(A\).  When \(f\) takes just
      two values we find that \(I_n\geq 0\) holds if and only if the variation
      of \(f\) in \(Q\) is at most \(2n^{\frac{n}{2}}\), a fact that is
      connected to work of A. Mielke and P. Sprenger (in J. Elasticity, 1998)
      on quasiconvexity at the boundary.  For more general (but still piecewise
      constant) \(f\), we show that \(I_n \geq 0\) is decided by both the
      geometry of the jump sets and the values taken by \(f\). This is joint
      work with Martin Kruzik and Jan Valdman.

      rotating star is modeled as a compressible fluid subject to gravity.
      Under certain conditions there exists a large family of solutions on
      which the supports of the stars become unbounded. The stars have a fixed
      mass and they rotate around a fixed axis at a speed that varies along the
      family.  I will also mention more elaborate models, including one that
      permits the entropy to be variable.

          <b>Gravitational Collapse of Self-Similar Stars</b><br/>
          The Euler-Poisson equations give the classical model of a
          self-gravitating star under Newtonian gravity. It is widely expected
          that, in certain regimes, initially smooth initial data may give rise
          to blow-up solutions, corresponding to the collapse of a star under
          its own gravity. In this talk, I will present recent work with Yan
          Guo, Mahir Hadzic and Juhi Jang that demonstrates the existence of
          smooth, radially symmetric, self-similar blow-up solutions for this
          problem. At the heart of the analysis is the presence of a sonic
          point, a singularity in the self-similar model that poses serious
          analytical challenges in the search for a smooth solution.

          <b>The Kawahara Equation</b><br/>
          The Kawahara equation is a 5th order dispersive equation, a
          higher order version of the KdV equation. Traveling waves satisfy
          a fourth-order ordinary differential equation in which the
          traveling wave speed \(c\) and a constant of integration \(A\) are
          parameters. A further integration yields the Hamiltonian, an
          invariant of all solutions. Periodic solutions are computed with
          an iterative spectral method, resulting in a family of periodic
          solutions depending on the three constants \(c\), \(A\) and wave number
          \(k\). We derive jump conditions between periodic solutions with
          different wave numbers but equal speeds and Hamiltonian. The jump
          conditions are necessary conditions for the existence of
          traveling waves that asymptote to the periodic orbits at
          infinity. Bifurcation theory and parameter continuation are then
          used to compute multiple solution branches for the jump
          conditions. From these, we construct heteroclinic orbits from the
          intersection of stable and unstable manifolds of compatible
          periodic solutions. Each branch terminates at an
          equilibrium-to-periodic solution in which the equilibrium is the
          background for a solitary wave that connects to the associated
          periodic solution. The jump conditions are closely related to
          Whitham shocks, discontinuous solutions of the Whitham modulation
          equations, suggesting the existence of wave structures more
          complex than the traveling waves presented here.

          <b>Stability of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum of weak turbulence</b></br>
          Weakly turbulent waves can be described by the kinetic wave
          equation. The first part of the talk will present results on the
          derivation of this effective equation from a microscopic system
          described by the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This kinetic wave
          equation has isotropic steady states called Kolmogorov–Zakharov
          spectra, that represent cascades of mass and energy between from
          small spatial scales toward large ones and conversely. The second
          part of the talk will discuss the stability of the spectrum
          associated to the indirect mass cascade. This is based on joint
          works with I. Ampatzoglou, H. Dietert, and P. Germain.

          <b>On traveling waves for the Gross–Pitaevskii equations</b><br/>
          In this talk, we will discuss some properties of traveling waves
          solutions for some variants of the classical Gross–Pitaevskii
          equation in the whole space, in order to include new physical models
          in Bose–Einstein condensates and nonlinear optics. We are interested
          in the existence of finite energy localized traveling waves solutions
          with nonvanishing conditions at infinity, i.e. dark solitons. After a
          review of the state of the art in the classical case, we will show
          some results for a family of Gross–Pitaevskii equations with nonlocal
          interactions in the potential energy, obtained by variational
          techniques. Then, we will discuss the existence and behavior of the
          dark solitons for the Gross–Pitaevskii equation is a strip, according
          to its width. This is joint work with Philippe Gravejat, Salvador
          Lopez-Martinez, and Didier Smets.

          <b>Oscillation vs. relaxation in galactic dynamics</b></br>
          We give an overview of recent developments in the stability study of
          nontrivial equilibria of the gravitational Vlasov–Poisson system. We
          discuss the existence of linear oscillating modes and the validity of
          the gravitational Landau damping in this context. Time permitting, we
          will also discuss the Einstein–Vlasov equilibria proving that steady
          galaxies with very dense cores lead to existence of growing mode
          instabilities in contrast to the Newtonian case. Our results
          highlight the importance of the Hamiltonian structure of these
          systems. The talk is based on published and ongoing works with Z.
          Lin, G. Rein, M. Schrecker, and C. Straub.

          <b>A strong Onsager conjecture on the Euler equations</b><br/>
          Smooth (spatially periodic) solutions to the incompressible 3D
          Euler equations have kinetic energy conservation in every local
          region, while turbulent flows exhibit anomalous dissipation of
          energy. Toward verification of the anomalous dissipation, the
          Onsager theorem, the threshold Hölder regularity of the total
          kinetic energy conservation is 1/3, has been proved by Isett. In
          this talk, I'll discuss a strong Onsager conjecture, which
          combines the Onsager theorem with the local energy inequality.

          <b>Boundary value problems for first-order elliptic operators with compact and noncompact boundary</b><br/>
          The index theorem for compact manifolds with boundary, established by
          Atiyah-Patodi-Singer in the mid-70s, is considered one of the most
          significant mathematical achievements of the 20th century. An
          important and curious fact is that local boundary conditions are
          topologically obstructed for index formulae and non-local  boundary
          conditions lie at the heart of this theorem. Consequently, this has
          inspired the study of boundary value problems for first-order
          elliptic differential operators by many different schools, with a
          class of induced  operators adapted to the boundary taking centre
          stage in formulating and understanding non-local boundary conditions.
          </p><p>
          That being said, much of this analysis has been confined to the
          situation when adapted boundary operators can be chosen self-adjoint.
          Dirac-type operators are the quintessential example. Nevertheless,
          natural geometric operators such as the Rarita-Schwinger operator on
          3/2-spiniors, arising from physics in the study of the so-called
          Delta baryon, falls outside of this class. Analytically, this
          requires analysis beyond self-adjoint operators. In recent work with
          Bär,  the compact boundary case is handled for general first-order
          elliptic operators, using spectral theory to choose adapted boundary
          operators to be invertible bi-sectorial. The Fourier circle methods
          present in the self-adjoint analysis are replaced by the  bounded
          holomorphic functional calculus, coupled with pseudo-differential
          operator theory and semi-group techniques. This allows for a full
          understanding of the maximal domain of the interior operator as a
          bounded surjection to a space on the boundary of mixed Sobolev
          regularity, constructed from spectral projectors associated to the
          adapted boundary operator. Regularity and Fredholm extensions are
          also studied.
          </p><p>
          For the noncompact case, a preliminary trace theorem as well as
          regularity theory are handed by resorting to the case with compact
          boundary. This necessitates  deforming the coefficients of the
          interior operator in a compact neighbourhood. Therefore, even for
          Dirac-type operators, allowing for fully general symbols in the
          compact boundary case is paramount. Under slightly stronger geometric
          assumptions near the noncompact boundary (automatic  for the compact
          case) and  when the interior operator admits a self-adjoint adapted
          boundary operator, an upgraded trace theorem mirroring the compact
          setting is obtained. Importantly, there is no spectral assumptions
          other than self-adjointness on the adapted boundary operator. This,
          in particular, means that the spectrum of this operator can be the
          entire real line. Again, the primarily tool that is used in the
          analysis is the bounded holomorphic functional calculus.

          <b>The role of boundary conditions in scaling laws for the Rayleigh–Bénard convection problem</b><br/>
          Rayleigh–Bénard convection is the buoyancy-driven flow of a fluid
          heated from below and cooled from above and is a paradigm for
          nonlinear dynamics with important applications in meteorology,
          oceanography and engineering. We are interested in obtaining
          quantitative bounds on the Nusselt number, the vertical heat
          transport enhancement factor. The Nusselt number, besides being an
          interesting quantity for engineering applications, is the natural
          quantity to measure the intensity and effectiveness of the motion.
          For this reason, we are interested in proving (upper) bounds which
          catch the relation between the Nusselt number and the (nondimensional
          control parameter) Rayleigh number, in turbulent regimes. Despite
          great scientific developments in this field in the last 30 years, it
          is still not clear what role the boundary conditions play in the
          scaling laws for the Nusselt number. In this talk we address this
          problem, establishing rigorous bounds for the Rayleigh–Bénard
          convection problem with Navier-slip boundary conditions for the
          velocity. We employ the background field method and deal with a
          careful PDE analysis, due to the production of vorticity at the
          walls. In conclusion, we relate this result to other bounds derived
          for no-slip and stress-free boundary conditions and discuss open
          problems. This seminar is based on a joint work with T. Drivas and H.
          Nguyen and on an ongoing project with F. Bleitner.
