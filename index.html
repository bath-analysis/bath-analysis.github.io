      <b>Can we have a little Order amidst all this Chaos?</b></br>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        Systems that involve many elements, be it a gas of particles or a herd of
        animals, are ubiquitous in our day to day lives. Their investigation,
        however, is hindered by the complexity of such systems and the amount of
        (usually coupled) equations that are needed to be solved.
        </p><p>
        The late 50’s has seen the birth of the so-called mean field limit
        approach as an attempt to circumvent some of the difficulties arising in
        treating such systems. Conceived by Kac as a way to give justification to
        the validity of the Boltzmann equation, the mean field limit approach
        attempts to find the behaviour of a limiting “average” element in a many
        element system and relies on two ingredients: an average model of the
        system (i.e. an evolution equation for the probability density of the
        ensemble), and an asymptotic correlation relation that expresses the
        emerging phenomena we expect to get as the number of elements goes to
        infinity.
        </p><p>
        Mean field limits of average models, originally applied to particle
        models, have permeated to fields beyond mathematical physics in recent
        decades. Examples include models that pertain to biological, chemical,
        and even societal phenomena. However, to date we use only one asymptotic
        correlation relation – chaos, the idea that the elements become more and
        more independent. While suitable when considering particles in a certain
        cavity, this assumptions doesn’t seem reasonable in models that pertain
        to biological and societal phenomena.
        </p><p>
        In our talk we will introduce Kac’s particle model and the notions of
        chaos and mean field limits. We will discuss the problem of having chaos
        as the sole asymptotic correlation relation and define a new asymptotic
        relation of order. We show that this is the right relation for a recent
        animal based model suggested by Carlen, Degond, and Wennberg, and
        highlight the importance of appropriate scaling in its investigation.

      <b>Is the optimal rectangle a square?</b></br>
      We give a light talk on an optimality of a square in geometry and
      physics. First, we recollect classical geometric results that the square
      has the largest area (respectively, the smallest perimeter) among all
      rectangles of a given perimeter (respectively, area). Second, we recall
      that the square drum has the lowest fundamental tone among all
      rectangular drums of a given area or perimeter and reinterpret the result
      in a quantum-mechanical language of nanostructures. As the main body of
      the talk, we present our recent attempts to prove the same
      spectral-geometric properties in relativistic quantum mechanics, where
      the mathematical model is a matrix-differential (Dirac) operator with
      complex (infinite-mass) boundary conditions. It is frustrating that such
      an illusively simple and expected result remains unproved and apparently
      out of the reach of current mathematical tools.

      <b>Blow-up criteria for an SPDE model of chemotaxis</b><br/>
      Chemotaxis and related phenomena have been an active area of mathematical
      research since statistical and PDE models were first proposed by C.
      Patlak (’53) and E. Keller &amp; L. Segel (’71). They are commonly
      studied through mean field PDE models and a common feature of these
      equations is the possibility of finite time blow-up under given model
      parameters. Recently it was shown that advection by a sufficiently strong
      relaxation enhancing vector field could suppress this blow up (Kiselev
      &amp; Xu ’16, Iyer, Zlatos &amp; Xu ’20). In this talk I will discuss new
      results (obtained with M. Tomašević) regarding criteria for the
      persistence of blow-up for an SPDE model of chemotaxis with stochastic
      advection. The noise we cover is of a form recently shown to be almost
      surely relaxation enhancing (Gess &amp; Yaroslavtsev ’21) and closely
      related to those studied in recent works by Galeati, Flandoli and Luo.

      <b>Well-posedness of the Lenard-Balescu equation with smooth interactions</b><br/>
      The Lenard–Balescu equation was formally derived in the 1960s as the
      fundamental description of the collisional process in a spatially
      homogeneous system of interacting particles. It can be viewed as
      correcting the standard Landau equation by taking into account collective
      screening effects. Due to the reputed complexity of the Lenard-Balescu
      equation in case of Coulomb interactions, its mathematical theory has
      remained void apart from the linearized setting. In this contribution, we
      focus on the case of smooth interactions and we show that dynamical
      screening effects can then be handled perturbatively. Taking inspiration
      from the Landau theory, we establish global well-posedness close to
      equilibrium, local well-posedness away from equilibrium, and we discuss
      the convergence to equilibrium and the validity of the Landau
      approximation. Joint work with Mitia Duerinckx (Université libre de
      Bruxelles).

      <b>Shifting Parties in Social Dynamics: a Nonlocal Approach</b><br/>
      The bounded confidence model is well-known for its dynamics of party
      formation within the sphere of social dynamics. We investigate the
      addition of bias terms, modeling shifts in opinions, and the resulting
      dynamics including coherent movement of parties. We analyze this movement
      using a novel, nonlocal approach for the study of the resulting
      forward-backward delay equations. Different from classical methods, we
      compute Taylor expansions in function space. This approach leads to an
      algebraically simple computation of the reduced flow on a center
      manifold, allowing for proof of coherent small-amplitude movement.

        existence of solutions with type II finite time blow-up in the

        The Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the plane arises as a physical model

        this equation with isolated vortices of degree \(+1\) or \(-1\),
        corresponding to concentration points of the associated fluid
        vorticity. The leading order vortex dynamics is governed by the

      <b>Stable self-similar blowup for the Keller–Segel model in three dimensions</b><br/>
      We consider the parabolic-elliptic Keller–Segel model for bacterial
      chemotaxis. We concentrate on the three-dimensional case, for which this
      model arises also as a simplified version of the isothermal Euler–Poisson
      system modeling stellar dynamics. From the work of Brenner et al. in
      1999, it is known that the 3D Keller–Segel model admits an explicit
      radial imploding self-similar solution. We prove the nonlinear radial
      asymptotic stability of this blowup profile. For this, we develop a novel
      stability analysis framework that applies to a large class of semilinear
      parabolic equations. In particular, we outline a robust technique to
      treat the underlying spectral problems. This is joint work with Birgit
      Schörkhuber (Innsbruck).

      <b>Propagation of regularity and uniqueness for a Kelvin–Voigt model in viscoelasticity</b><br/>
      We consider nonlinear viscoelastic materials of Kelvin–Voigt type with
      stored energies satisfying an Andrews–Ball condition, allowing for
      non-convexity in a compact set, and a linear viscous stress. We show the
      existence of weak solutions with deformation gradients in \(H^1\) for
      energies of any superquadratic growth. In two space dimensions, and in a
      striking analogy to the incompressible Euler equations with bounded
      vorticity, weak solutions turn out to be unique in this class.
      Conservation of energy for these solutions in two and three dimensions,
      as well as global regularity for smooth initial data in two dimensions
      are also established under additional restrictions on the growth of the
      stored energy. This is joint work with C. Lattanzio, S. Spirito, and A.E.

       I will consider the critical Brezis–Nirenberg problem on bounded
       domains. It is well known that existence and multiplicity of positive
       and sign-changing solutions to this equation is strictly affected by the
       geometry of the domain and the dimension of the euclidean space where
       the domain lies. In particular I will discuss the existence of

       <b>Long term behaviour: From particle dynamics through kinetic equations to fractional diffusion equations</b><br/>
       The derivation of continuum equations from a discrete deterministic system of
       particles is of major interest. This is an area of research in mathematical
       physics originating from Hilbert's Sixth Problem in 1900. This problem has been
       approached in two steps using the Boltzmann equation as a mesoscopic
       description. The first one is to derive kinetic equations, such as the
       Boltzmann equation, from a system of particles and the second is to derive
       continuum equations, such as Navier–Stokes and Euler equations, from the
       Boltzmann equation. Our work is aiming at deriving (fractional) diffusive
       behaviour from particle models, which can be split in two separate questions.
       The first one is to derive linear Boltzmann equations from a Rayleigh gas
       particle system with a fat-tailed background in a suitable limit of many small
       particles. As a second one is the derivation of diffusive behaviour of linear
       Boltzmann equations by a scaling limit.

      <b>Steklov eigenvalues of negatively curved manifolds</b><br/>
      The geometry and topology of negatively curved manifolds are subtly
      reflected in a geometric bound for the Laplace eigenvalues, a connection
      that has been explored since the 1980s. Among these results, we can
      mention the celebrated result of Schone in 1982 on the Laplace spectral
      gap on closed negatively curved manifolds of dimension at least three.
      Building upon these foundational studies in the Laplace case, we study
      the Steklov eigenvalues of pinched negatively curved manifolds with
      totally geodesic boundaries. The Steklov eigenvalues are associated with
      a first-order elliptic pseudodifferential operator known as the
      Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator.  We discuss a counterpart of Schone's
      result for the Steklov problem on negatively curved manifolds of
      dimension at least three. This talk is based on joint work with Ara
      Basmajian, Jade Brisson, and Antoine Métras.
