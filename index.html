      <b>Optimal transport methods in geophysical fluid dynamics</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        This is work in collaboration with David Bourne and two former PhD students. We have used
        semi-discrete optimal transport to give new proofs of existence and regularity of weak 
        solutions to a system of equations, both incompressible and compressible, modelling
        large-scale atmospheric flows.  This method also yields the first fully 3D numerical simulations,
        and several new theoretical side results. More generally, I can discuss the formulation of a variety
        of geophysical fluid problems using optimal transport, yielding naturally the proof of physically 
        conjectured properties.

      <b>Recent progress on the fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        In 1974, Loewner and Nirenberg established that any smooth bounded Euclidean domain admits a 
        conformally flat metric which is complete in the interior and has constant negative scalar curvature.
        Generalisations to compact manifolds with boundary, asymptotic expansions of solutions and other 
        related problems have since received significant attention from many authors (Aviles, McOwen, Mazzeo etc.) 

        In this talk I will discuss recent work with Luc Nguyen on generalisations of the Loewner-Nirenberg problem,
        in which one replaces the scalar curvature with other curvature quantities involving the Schouten tensor.
        These problems involve solving fully nonlinear, non-uniformly elliptic PDEs with infinite boundary data.
        In particular, I will discuss our recent existence results which yield solutions on arbitrary compact
        manifolds with boundary, and I will also discuss some surprising non-uniqueness phenomena in the upper 
        half space, demonstrating that the 'expected' Liouville theorems do not always hold.

      <b>Liquid crystal flows with free boundaries</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        I will report on some recent works about a new model of liquid crystal
        flows enjoying a geometric free boundary condition. After recalling
        some classical models on liquid crystal flows, I will explain how to
        incorporate a free boundary condition, in relation with harmonic
        mappings with partially free boundary. I will develop on some results
        about those mappings and how they can be used to derive some regularity
        and partial regularity results for this new liquid crystal system. I
        will explain also how parabolic gluing can be exploited to construct
        some blow-up solutions.

      <b>Phase-shifted nanopterons in a singularly perturbed Korteweg-de Vries model equation</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        A nanopteron is a traveling wave whose profile is the superposition of an exponentially
        localized “core” term and a small-amplitude periodic “ripple” term.  I will discuss the 
        construction of nanopteron traveling wave solutions to a versatile ordinary differential 
        equation that is a singular perturbation of the traveling wave ODE for the Korteweg-de Vries 
        (KdV) equation.  The nanopteron problem permits two free variables—the amplitude and the phase
        shift of the periodic ripple—and I will highlight how each variable separately resolves what
        is otherwise an overdetermined perturbation problem.  This nanopteron construction draws on
        techniques from bifurcation theory, functional analysis, Fourier analysis, and oscillatory 
        integral theory and generalizes and unifies a variety of approaches by Amick and Toland, Sun
        and Shen, and Lombardi.  More broadly, this perturbed KdV equation has served as a valuable 
        model for singularly perturbed nonlocal problems posed on lattices, and I will sketch how
        many technical complications in lattices show up transparently here.

      <b>Eigenvalue optimisation in geometric analysis</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        The study of sharp upper bounds for Laplacian eigenvalues under area constraints is a classical topic
        in spectral geometry. A key source of interest lies in the remarkable fact that metrics achieving equality
        in such bounds correspond to metrics induced by minimal surfaces in spheres. Even more strikingly, 
        analogous connections between eigenvalues and natural geometric structures continue to emerge across 
        diverse settings.
        
        In this talk, I will highlight notable examples of these correspondences and discuss their implications for 
        both spectral estimates and geometric analysis.

      <b>Think Global, Act Local: Inducing Fully Localised 2D Patterns via Spatial Heterogeneity</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        The existence of localised two-dimensional patterns has been observed
        and studied in numerous experiments and simulations: ranging from
        optical solitons, to patches of desert vegetation, to fluid convection.
        And yet, our mathematical understanding of these emerging structures
        remains extremely limited beyond one-dimensional examples.
        </p><p>
        In this talk I will discuss how adding a compact region of spatial
        heterogeneity to a PDE model can not only induce the emergence of fully
        localised 2D patterns, but also allows us to rigorously prove and characterise
        their bifurcation. The idea is inspired by experimental and numerical studies
        of magnetic fluids and tornados, where our compact heterogeneity corresponds to
        a local spike in the magnetic field and temperature gradient, respectively. In
        particular, we obtain local bifurcation results for fully localised patterns
        both with and without radial or dihedral symmetry, and rigorously continue
        these solutions to large amplitude. Notably, the initial bifurcating solution
        (which can be stable at bifurcation) varies between a radially-symmetric spot
        and a ‘dipole’ solution as the width of the spatial heterogeneity increases.
        </p>
        This work is in collaboration with David J.B. Lloyd and Matthew R.
        Turner (both University of Surrey).

      <b>Quantitative Regularity and Analyticity of the 3D Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations in Critical Spaces</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        This talk presents some of my recent joint work with P.-T. Nguyen, Q.-H. Nguyen, and P. Zhang.
      </p><p>
        In the first part, after reviewing several qualitative and quantitative
        regularity criteria for the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes system, I
        will discuss our recent results that extend T. Tao’s theorem from $L^3$
        solutions to $\dot B_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}$ solutions. In
        particular, we obtain a new blow-up rate estimate in lower regularity
        spaces. The proof relies on refined Carleman inequalities and carefully
        constructed approximate solutions. 
        </p><p> 
        In the second part, I will focus on the instantaneous radius of
        analyticity. After introducing the concept and some classical results,
        I will describe several new bilinear estimates that enable us to
        establish an optimal lower bound of radius of analyticity for solutions
        with $L^p$ initial data.

      <b>Global solutions to a time-fractional nonlinear acoustics model</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        In this talk, I will discuss the existence of global solutions to a 
        time-fractionally damped nonlinear Jordan—Moore—Gibson—Thompson (JMGT) model. 
        JMGT models arise when considering a class of thermal relaxation laws in the
        modelling of sound wave propagation through complex media (such as human tissue).
      </p><p>
        From the analysis point of view, we place ourselves in the so-called critical case
        (most challenging for JMGT equations), such that the nonlinearity structure and
        time-fractional kernel must be properly exploited to extract sufficient dissipation
        to rule out blow-up. Doing so, we obtain a global existence result for small data. 
        </p><p>

      <b>Anomalous Regularization in Kazantsev-Kraichnan Model</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        We investigate a passive vector field which is transported and stretched by a divergence-free Gaussian
        velocity field, delta-correlated in time and poorly correlated in space (spatially nonsmooth).
        Although the advection of a scalar field (Kraichnan's passive scalar model) is known to enjoy regularizing 
        properties, the potentially competing stretching term in vector advection may induce singularity formation.
        We establish that the regularization effect is actually retained in certain regimes. While this is true in
        any dimension $d\ge 3$, it notably implies a regularization result for linearized 3D Euler equations with
        stochastic modeling of turbulent velocities, and for the induction equation in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.
        The presentation is based on a joint work with Francesco Grotto and Mario Maurelli.

      <b>Solitonic Travelling Waves for the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation in a Strip</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        We present work on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the infinite strip $\mathbb{R} \times (0,l)$,
        for positive width $l>0$, with Neumann boundary conditions. The one dimensional equation on 
        $\mathbb{R}$ admits a family of travelling wave solutions for wave speeds $|c|<\sqrt{2}$, $S_{c}$. 

        We show that for wave speeds $c$ close enough to $0$ and values of $l$ close enough to some critical
        widths $l_{c,k}$, $k\geq 1$ an integer, there are travelling wave solutions $\Psi_{l,k}$ that
        bifurcate from $S_{c}$, and depend smoothly on the strip width $l$.

         <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
           It is well known that the harmonic map heat flow from a surface may
           develop finite-time singularities, even for initial data arbitrarily
           close to a steady state. In this talk, I will present a result that
           identifies a class of perturbations around a least-energy harmonic
           map $W: \mathbb R^2 \to S^2$ for which the corresponding solution of
           the heat flow remains stable: it exists globally, stays close to a
           least energy harmonic map for all time, and converges as $t \to
           \infty$ at a quantified rate.

        <b>A Regularity Theory for the Approximated Harmonic Map Equation</b><br/>
          <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
            Let $M$ and $N\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be smooth, compact Riemannian manifolds where $\dim M\geq 3$ and where $M$ may possibly
            have boundary. In this setting, we consider the approximated harmonic map equation 
            $\Delta_M u+ A(u)(\nabla u ,\nabla u) = f$ for maps $u\in W^{1,2}(M;N)$, where $f\in L^p(M;\mathbb{R}^n)$.
            In this talk, we will motivate the study of this equation and outline regularity results for solutions to this
            equation when $p\in(1,\infty)$. Namely, under a certain smallness condition on the gradient of $u$, we will show that
            the solutions enjoy the regularity expected of solutions to linear elliptic equations, including up to the boundary.
            As an application, we prove a partial regularity result for weak solutions of the harmonic map heat flow satisfying 
            a monotonicity inequality. These results are extensions of work by Roger Moser in the paper 'An $L^p$ regularity 
            theory for harmonic maps' from 2015.
