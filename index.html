          <b>Gravitational Collapse of Self-Similar Stars</b><br/>
          The Euler-Poisson equations give the classical model of a
          self-gravitating star under Newtonian gravity. It is widely expected
          that, in certain regimes, initially smooth initial data may give rise
          to blow-up solutions, corresponding to the collapse of a star under
          its own gravity. In this talk, I will present recent work with Yan
          Guo, Mahir Hadzic and Juhi Jang that demonstrates the existence of
          smooth, radially symmetric, self-similar blow-up solutions for this
          problem. At the heart of the analysis is the presence of a sonic
          point, a singularity in the self-similar model that poses serious
          analytical challenges in the search for a smooth solution.

          <b>The Kawahara Equation</b><br/>
          The Kawahara equation is a 5th order dispersive equation, a
          higher order version of the KdV equation. Traveling waves satisfy
          a fourth-order ordinary differential equation in which the
          traveling wave speed \(c\) and a constant of integration \(A\) are
          parameters. A further integration yields the Hamiltonian, an
          invariant of all solutions. Periodic solutions are computed with
          an iterative spectral method, resulting in a family of periodic
          solutions depending on the three constants \(c\), \(A\) and wave number
          \(k\). We derive jump conditions between periodic solutions with
          different wave numbers but equal speeds and Hamiltonian. The jump
          conditions are necessary conditions for the existence of
          traveling waves that asymptote to the periodic orbits at
          infinity. Bifurcation theory and parameter continuation are then
          used to compute multiple solution branches for the jump
          conditions. From these, we construct heteroclinic orbits from the
          intersection of stable and unstable manifolds of compatible
          periodic solutions. Each branch terminates at an
          equilibrium-to-periodic solution in which the equilibrium is the
          background for a solitary wave that connects to the associated
          periodic solution. The jump conditions are closely related to
          Whitham shocks, discontinuous solutions of the Whitham modulation
          equations, suggesting the existence of wave structures more
          complex than the traveling waves presented here.

          <b>Stability of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum of weak turbulence</b></br>
          Weakly turbulent waves can be described by the kinetic wave
          equation. The first part of the talk will present results on the
          derivation of this effective equation from a microscopic system
          described by the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This kinetic wave
          equation has isotropic steady states called Kolmogorov–Zakharov
          spectra, that represent cascades of mass and energy between from
          small spatial scales toward large ones and conversely. The second
          part of the talk will discuss the stability of the spectrum
          associated to the indirect mass cascade. This is based on joint
          works with I. Ampatzoglou, H. Dietert, and P. Germain.
