      <b>Is the optimal rectangle a square?</b></br>
      We give a light talk on an optimality of a square in geometry and
      physics. First, we recollect classical geometric results that the square
      has the largest area (respectively, the smallest perimeter) among all
      rectangles of a given perimeter (respectively, area). Second, we recall
      that the square drum has the lowest fundamental tone among all
      rectangular drums of a given area or perimeter and reinterpret the result
      in a quantum-mechanical language of nanostructures. As the main body of
      the talk, we present our recent attempts to prove the same
      spectral-geometric properties in relativistic quantum mechanics, where
      the mathematical model is a matrix-differential (Dirac) operator with
      complex (infinite-mass) boundary conditions. It is frustrating that such
      an illusively simple and expected result remains unproved and apparently
      out of the reach of current mathematical tools.

      <b>Blow-up criteria for an SPDE model of chemotaxis</b><br/>
      Chemotaxis and related phenomena have been an active area of mathematical
      research since statistical and PDE models were first proposed by C.
      Patlak (’53) and E. Keller &amp; L. Segel (’71). They are commonly
      studied through mean field PDE models and a common feature of these
      equations is the possibility of finite time blow-up under given model
      parameters. Recently it was shown that advection by a sufficiently strong
      relaxation enhancing vector field could suppress this blow up (Kiselev
      &amp; Xu ’16, Iyer, Zlatos &amp; Xu ’20). In this talk I will discuss new
      results (obtained with M. Tomašević) regarding criteria for the
      persistence of blow-up for an SPDE model of chemotaxis with stochastic
      advection. The noise we cover is of a form recently shown to be almost
      surely relaxation enhancing (Gess &amp; Yaroslavtsev ’21) and closely
      related to those studied in recent works by Galeati, Flandoli and Luo.

      <b>Asymptotic stability of solitary waves in dimension one</b><br/>
      I will present work on the asymptotic stability of solitary waves for
      two 1D models: nonlinear Klein-Gordon (kinks), and nonlinear Schrodinger
      (bright solitons). An important idea in the proof is the treatment of
      resonances, through the distorted Fourier transform. This is joint work
      with Fabio Pusateri and Charles Collot.

      <b>Well-posedness of the Lenard-Balescu equation with smooth interactions</b><br/>
      The Lenard–Balescu equation was formally derived in the 1960s as the
      fundamental description of the collisional process in a spatially
      homogeneous system of interacting particles. It can be viewed as
      correcting the standard Landau equation by taking into account collective
      screening effects. Due to the reputed complexity of the Lenard-Balescu
      equation in case of Coulomb interactions, its mathematical theory has
      remained void apart from the linearized setting. In this contribution, we
      focus on the case of smooth interactions and we show that dynamical
      screening effects can then be handled perturbatively. Taking inspiration
      from the Landau theory, we establish global well-posedness close to
      equilibrium, local well-posedness away from equilibrium, and we discuss
      the convergence to equilibrium and the validity of the Landau
      approximation. Joint work with Mitia Duerinckx (Université libre de
      Bruxelles).

      <b>Shifting Parties in Social Dynamics: a Nonlocal Approach</b><br/>
      The bounded confidence model is well-known for its dynamics of party
      formation within the sphere of social dynamics. We investigate the
      addition of bias terms, modeling shifts in opinions, and the resulting
      dynamics including coherent movement of parties. We analyze this movement
      using a novel, nonlocal approach for the study of the resulting
      forward-backward delay equations. Different from classical methods, we
      compute Taylor expansions in function space. This approach leads to an
      algebraically simple computation of the reduced flow on a center
      manifold, allowing for proof of coherent small-amplitude movement.

        <b>Finite time blow-up for the Keller-Segel system</b><br/>
        The Keller–Segel system is a model for chemotactic aggregation and is a
        nonlocal non-linear reaction diffusion equation. I will discuss
        existence of solutions with type II finite time blow-up in the
        3-dimensional, axially-symmetric case. An intermediate step is a
        construction by gluing techniques of finite time blow-up solutions in
        the 2-dimensional case. This is a joint work with Juan Dávila, Manuel
        del Pino and Monica Musso.

        <b>Vortex dynamics for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation</b><br/>
        The Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the plane arises as a physical model
        for an idealized, two-dimensional superfluid. We construct solutions to
        this equation with isolated vortices of degree \(+1\) or \(-1\),
        corresponding to concentration points of the associated fluid
        vorticity. The leading order vortex dynamics is governed by the
        classical Kirchhoff law, and our method provides detailed information
        on the asymptotic profile of the solutions near the vortex set. This is
        joint work with Manuel del Pino and Monica Musso.

      <b>Stable self-similar blowup for the Keller–Segel model in three dimensions</b><br/>
      We consider the parabolic-elliptic Keller–Segel model for bacterial
      chemotaxis. We concentrate on the three-dimensional case, for which this
      model arises also as a simplified version of the isothermal Euler–Poisson
      system modeling stellar dynamics. From the work of Brenner et al. in
      1999, it is known that the 3D Keller–Segel model admits an explicit
      radial imploding self-similar solution. We prove the nonlinear radial
      asymptotic stability of this blowup profile. For this, we develop a novel
      stability analysis framework that applies to a large class of semilinear
      parabolic equations. In particular, we outline a robust technique to
      treat the underlying spectral problems. This is joint work with Birgit
      Schörkhuber (Innsbruck).

      <b>\(L^2\)-stability for the 4-waves kinetic equation around the Rayleigh–Jeans equilibrium</b><br/>
      We consider the four-waves spatial homogeneous kinetic equation arising
      in weak wave turbulence theory. In this talk I will present some new
      results on the existence and long-time behaviour of solutions around the
      Rayleigh–Jeans thermodynamic equilibrium solutions. In particular, I will
      present an \(L^2\) stability of mild solutions on the whole frequency
      space for initial data close to Rayleigh–Jeans when assuming radial
      solutions for the equation, as well as a stability of the same kind
      without the radial solution-assumption but after introducing a cut-off on
      the frequencies. Parts of this talk are joint works with Miguel Escobedo
      (UPV/EHU).

      <b>Propagation of regularity and uniqueness for a Kelvin–Voigt model in viscoelasticity</b><br/>
      We consider nonlinear viscoelastic materials of Kelvin–Voigt type with
      stored energies satisfying an Andrews–Ball condition, allowing for
      non-convexity in a compact set, and a linear viscous stress. We show the
      existence of weak solutions with deformation gradients in \(H^1\) for
      energies of any superquadratic growth. In two space dimensions, and in a
      striking analogy to the incompressible Euler equations with bounded
      vorticity, weak solutions turn out to be unique in this class.
      Conservation of energy for these solutions in two and three dimensions,
      as well as global regularity for smooth initial data in two dimensions
      are also established under additional restrictions on the growth of the
      stored energy. This is joint work with C. Lattanzio, S. Spirito, and A.E.
