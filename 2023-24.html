      <b>Non-equilibrium steady states for the BGK equation for dilute gasses</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        This is based on a joint work with Angeliki Menegaki. I will talk about
        the BGK equation which is a simplification of Boltzmann's equation for
        dilute gasses. We look at the situation where we couple the equation to a
        thermostat meaning that heat can enter and leave the system. This
        produces a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). I will discuss the
        challenges in showing convergence towards a NESS and maybe how this is
        connected to derivation of Fourier's law.

      <b>Adjoint Brascamp-Lieb inequalities</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        The Brascamp–Lieb inequalities are a generalisation of the Hölder,
        Loomis–Whitney and Young convolution inequalities, and have found many
        applications in harmonic analysis and elsewhere. In this talk we present an
        “adjoint” version of these inequalities which may be viewed as an $L^p$
        version of the entropic Brascamp–Lieb inequalities of Carlen and
        Cordero–Erausquin. As an application we establish some lower bounds on a
        range of tomographic transforms, such as the classical X-ray and Radon
        transforms. This is joint work with Terence Tao.

      <b>Can we have a little Order amidst all this Chaos?</b></br>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        Systems that involve many elements, be it a gas of particles or a herd of
        animals, are ubiquitous in our day to day lives. Their investigation,
        however, is hindered by the complexity of such systems and the amount of
        (usually coupled) equations that are needed to be solved.
        </p><p>
        The late 50’s has seen the birth of the so-called mean field limit
        approach as an attempt to circumvent some of the difficulties arising in
        treating such systems. Conceived by Kac as a way to give justification to
        the validity of the Boltzmann equation, the mean field limit approach
        attempts to find the behaviour of a limiting “average” element in a many
        element system and relies on two ingredients: an average model of the
        system (i.e. an evolution equation for the probability density of the
        ensemble), and an asymptotic correlation relation that expresses the
        emerging phenomena we expect to get as the number of elements goes to
        infinity.
        </p><p>
        Mean field limits of average models, originally applied to particle
        models, have permeated to fields beyond mathematical physics in recent
        decades. Examples include models that pertain to biological, chemical,
        and even societal phenomena. However, to date we use only one asymptotic
        correlation relation – chaos, the idea that the elements become more and
        more independent. While suitable when considering particles in a certain
        cavity, this assumptions doesn’t seem reasonable in models that pertain
        to biological and societal phenomena.
        </p><p>
        In our talk we will introduce Kac’s particle model and the notions of
        chaos and mean field limits. We will discuss the problem of having chaos
        as the sole asymptotic correlation relation and define a new asymptotic
        relation of order. We show that this is the right relation for a recent
        animal based model suggested by Carlen, Degond, and Wennberg, and
        highlight the importance of appropriate scaling in its investigation.

      <b>Normalized solutions for nonlinear Schrödinger equations with $L^2$ critical nonlinearity</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        We study the existence of normalized solutions $u\in H^1(\mathbf R^N)$ for the following
        nonlinear Schrödinger equation:
        \[
          \left\{ 
          \begin{aligned}
            -&\Delta u + \mu u = g(u) \quad \hbox{in}\ \mathbf R^N, \\
             &{1\over 2}\int_{\mathbf R^N} u^2\, dx =m,
          \end{aligned}
          \right.
        \]
        where $N\geq 2$, $m>0$ is a fixed mass, and $\mu>0$ is a unknown Lagrange multiplier.
        We consider the case where $g(s)$ has $L^2$ critical growth asymptotically as
        $s\sim 0$ and $s\sim\pm\infty$, that is,
        \[  
          g(s)= |s|^{p-1}s + h(s), \quad p=1+{4\over N},
        \]
        where $h(s)$ satisfies 
        \[  
          {h(s)\over |s|^{p-1}s}\to 0 \quad 
          \hbox{as}\ s\to 0 \ \hbox{and}\ s\to\pm \infty.
        \]
        We show existence and non-existence results.

      <b>Boundary states of the magnetic Robin Laplacian</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        We will discuss the spectral analysis of the Robin Laplacian on a smooth 
        bounded two-dimensional domain in the presence of a constant magnetic 
        field. In the semiclassical limit, I will explain how to get a uniform 
        description of the spectrum located between the Landau levels. The 
        corresponding eigenfunctions, called edge states, are exponentially 
        localized near the boundary. By means of a microlocal dimensional 
        reduction, I will explain how to derive a very precise Weyl law and a 
        proof of quantum magnetic oscillations for excited states, and also how 
        to refine simultaneously old results about the low-lying eigenvalues in 
        the Robin case and recent ones about edge states in the Dirichlet case.

      <b>Three-dimensional gravity-capillary solitary waves on Beltrami flows</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        In this talk I consider steady gravity-capillary surface waves ‘riding’
        a perfect fluid in Beltrami flow (a three-dimensional flow with
        parallel velocity and vorticity fields). I will first demonstrate how
        the hydrodynamic problem can be formulated as two equations for two
        scalar functions of the horizontal spatial coordinates, namely the
        elevation of the free surface and the potential defining the gradient
        part (in the sense of the Hodge–Weyl decomposition) of the horizontal
        component of the tangential fluid velocity there. The formulation is
        nonlocal, has a variational structure and generalises the
        Zakharov–Craig–Sulem formulation for the classical water-wave problem,
        reducing to it in the irrotational limit.
      </p><p>
        Starting from the above formulation, one can derive the
        Kadomtsev–Petviashvili-I (KP-I) equation (strong surface tension) or
        the Davey–Stewartson (DS) system (weak surface tension) for such
        Beltrami flows using formal weakly nonlinear theory. These equations
        have ‘lump’ solutions and thus predict the existence of fully localised
        solitary water waves for the full problem. I will show how to
        rigorously reduce the full problem to a perturbation of the KP-I or DS
        equations and thus construct an existence proof for fully localised
        solitary waves ‘riding’ Beltrami flows.

      <b>Entropy Analysis and Singularities of Solutions for Nonlinear Conservation Laws</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        In this talk, we present some reflections and recent developments on
        solving several longstanding open problems involving the singularities
        of entropy solutions for nonlinear conservation laws and related
        nonlinear partial differential equations through entropy analysis and
        associated methods. These problems are concerned with the minimal
        entropy conditions for well-posedness, cavitation/decavitation,
        concentration/deconcentration, and rigorous analysis for entropy
        solutions involving the singularities via the theory of
        divergence-measure fields, among others. Further related topics,
        perspectives, and open problems will also be addressed.

      <b>Semiclassical analysis of free fermions</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        To each orthogonal projector of finite rank N on $L^2(R^d)$ is associated a
        point process on $R^d$ with N points, which gives the joint probability density
        of fermions that fill the image of the projector.
      </p><p>
        The study of the statistical properties of these fermions, in the large
        N limit, is linked to semiclassical spectral theory problems, some of
        them well studied (the Weyl law gives a law of large numbers), some of
        them new. In particular, the behaviour of the variance is linked with
        the properties of commutators involving spectral projectors, which are
        not so well understood. 
      </p><p>
        In this talk, I will present my work in collaboration with Gaultier
        Lambert (KTH) on this topic.

      <b>Gravitational Landau Damping</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        In the 1960s, Lynden-Bell, studying the dynamics of galaxies around
        steady states of the gravitational Vlasov–Poisson equation, described a
        phenomenon he called “violent relaxation,” a convergence to equilibrium
        through phase mixing analogous in some respects to Landau damping in
        plasma physics. In this talk, I will discuss recent work on this
        gravitational Landau damping for the linearised Vlasov–Poisson
        equation. In particular, I will discuss the critical role played by the
        interaction of the vacuum boundary for the kinetic Vlasov equation with
        the elliptic regularisation of the Poisson equation in distinguishing
        damping from oscillatory behaviour in the perturbations. This is based
        on joint work with Mahir Hadzic, Gerhard Rein, and Christopher Straub.

      <b>Entropy maximization in the two-dimensional Euler equations</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        We investigate certain questions arising in two-dimensional statistical
        hydrodynamics, by relying on principles of entropy maximization for the
        vorticity of a two-dimensional perfect fluid in a disc. In analogy with
        the entropy functions used in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics,
        we show that similar concavity properties hold for the 2d Euler
        equations when maximizing entropies at fixed energy levels. The proofs
        rely on rearrangement inequalities, a modification of the classical
        min-max principle, and the properties of the Euler–Lagrange equations
        for the corresponding constrained optimization.

      <b>Stability for relativistic fluids on slowly expanding cosmological spacetimes</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        On a background Minkowski spacetime, the Euler equations (both relativistic and
        not) are known to admit unstable homogeneous solutions with finite-time shock
        formation. Such shock formation can be suppressed on cosmological spacetimes
        whose spatial slices expand at an accelerated rate. However situations with
        decelerated expansion, which are relevant in our early universe, are not as
        well understood. I will present some recent joint work in this direction, based
        on collaborations with David Fajman, Maciej Maliborski, Todd Oliynyk and Max
        Ofner.

      <b>Is the optimal rectangle a square?</b></br>
      We give a light talk on an optimality of a square in geometry and
      physics. First, we recollect classical geometric results that the square
      has the largest area (respectively, the smallest perimeter) among all
      rectangles of a given perimeter (respectively, area). Second, we recall
      that the square drum has the lowest fundamental tone among all
      rectangular drums of a given area or perimeter and reinterpret the result
      in a quantum-mechanical language of nanostructures. As the main body of
      the talk, we present our recent attempts to prove the same
      spectral-geometric properties in relativistic quantum mechanics, where
      the mathematical model is a matrix-differential (Dirac) operator with
      complex (infinite-mass) boundary conditions. It is frustrating that such
      an illusively simple and expected result remains unproved and apparently
      out of the reach of current mathematical tools.

      <b>Blow-up criteria for an SPDE model of chemotaxis</b><br/>
      Chemotaxis and related phenomena have been an active area of mathematical
      research since statistical and PDE models were first proposed by C.
      Patlak (’53) and E. Keller &amp; L. Segel (’71). They are commonly
      studied through mean field PDE models and a common feature of these
      equations is the possibility of finite time blow-up under given model
      parameters. Recently it was shown that advection by a sufficiently strong
      relaxation enhancing vector field could suppress this blow up (Kiselev
      &amp; Xu ’16, Iyer, Zlatos &amp; Xu ’20). In this talk I will discuss new
      results (obtained with M. Tomašević) regarding criteria for the
      persistence of blow-up for an SPDE model of chemotaxis with stochastic
      advection. The noise we cover is of a form recently shown to be almost
      surely relaxation enhancing (Gess &amp; Yaroslavtsev ’21) and closely
      related to those studied in recent works by Galeati, Flandoli and Luo.

      <b>Well-posedness of the Lenard-Balescu equation with smooth interactions</b><br/>
      The Lenard–Balescu equation was formally derived in the 1960s as the
      fundamental description of the collisional process in a spatially
      homogeneous system of interacting particles. It can be viewed as
      correcting the standard Landau equation by taking into account collective
      screening effects. Due to the reputed complexity of the Lenard-Balescu
      equation in case of Coulomb interactions, its mathematical theory has
      remained void apart from the linearized setting. In this contribution, we
      focus on the case of smooth interactions and we show that dynamical
      screening effects can then be handled perturbatively. Taking inspiration
      from the Landau theory, we establish global well-posedness close to
      equilibrium, local well-posedness away from equilibrium, and we discuss
      the convergence to equilibrium and the validity of the Landau
      approximation. Joint work with Mitia Duerinckx (Université libre de
      Bruxelles).

      <b>Shifting Parties in Social Dynamics: a Nonlocal Approach</b><br/>
      The bounded confidence model is well-known for its dynamics of party
      formation within the sphere of social dynamics. We investigate the
      addition of bias terms, modeling shifts in opinions, and the resulting
      dynamics including coherent movement of parties. We analyze this movement
      using a novel, nonlocal approach for the study of the resulting
      forward-backward delay equations. Different from classical methods, we
      compute Taylor expansions in function space. This approach leads to an
      algebraically simple computation of the reduced flow on a center
      manifold, allowing for proof of coherent small-amplitude movement.

        <b>Finite time blow-up for the Keller-Segel system</b><br/>
        The Keller–Segel system is a model for chemotactic aggregation and is a
        nonlocal non-linear reaction diffusion equation. I will discuss
        existence of solutions with type II finite time blow-up in the
        3-dimensional, axially-symmetric case. An intermediate step is a
        construction by gluing techniques of finite time blow-up solutions in
        the 2-dimensional case. This is a joint work with Juan Dávila, Manuel
        del Pino and Monica Musso.

        <b>Vortex dynamics for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation</b><br/>
        The Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the plane arises as a physical model
        for an idealized, two-dimensional superfluid. We construct solutions to
        this equation with isolated vortices of degree $+1$ or $-1$,
        corresponding to concentration points of the associated fluid
        vorticity. The leading order vortex dynamics is governed by the
        classical Kirchhoff law, and our method provides detailed information
        on the asymptotic profile of the solutions near the vortex set. This is
        joint work with Manuel del Pino and Monica Musso.

      <b>Stable self-similar blowup for the Keller–Segel model in three dimensions</b><br/>
      We consider the parabolic-elliptic Keller–Segel model for bacterial
      chemotaxis. We concentrate on the three-dimensional case, for which this
      model arises also as a simplified version of the isothermal Euler–Poisson
      system modeling stellar dynamics. From the work of Brenner et al. in
      1999, it is known that the 3D Keller–Segel model admits an explicit
      radial imploding self-similar solution. We prove the nonlinear radial
      asymptotic stability of this blowup profile. For this, we develop a novel
      stability analysis framework that applies to a large class of semilinear
      parabolic equations. In particular, we outline a robust technique to
      treat the underlying spectral problems. This is joint work with Birgit
      Schörkhuber (Innsbruck).

      <b>$L^2$-stability for the 4-waves kinetic equation around the Rayleigh–Jeans equilibrium</b><br/>
      We consider the four-waves spatial homogeneous kinetic equation arising
      in weak wave turbulence theory. In this talk I will present some new
      results on the existence and long-time behaviour of solutions around the
      Rayleigh–Jeans thermodynamic equilibrium solutions. In particular, I will
      present an $L^2$ stability of mild solutions on the whole frequency
      space for initial data close to Rayleigh–Jeans when assuming radial
      solutions for the equation, as well as a stability of the same kind
      without the radial solution-assumption but after introducing a cut-off on
      the frequencies. Parts of this talk are joint works with Miguel Escobedo
      (UPV/EHU).

      <b>Propagation of regularity and uniqueness for a Kelvin–Voigt model in viscoelasticity</b><br/>
      We consider nonlinear viscoelastic materials of Kelvin–Voigt type with
      stored energies satisfying an Andrews–Ball condition, allowing for
      non-convexity in a compact set, and a linear viscous stress. We show the
      existence of weak solutions with deformation gradients in $H^1$ for
      energies of any superquadratic growth. In two space dimensions, and in a
      striking analogy to the incompressible Euler equations with bounded
      vorticity, weak solutions turn out to be unique in this class.
      Conservation of energy for these solutions in two and three dimensions,
      as well as global regularity for smooth initial data in two dimensions
      are also established under additional restrictions on the growth of the
      stored energy. This is joint work with C. Lattanzio, S. Spirito, and A.E.

       <b>The Brezis-Nirenberg problem in the higher-dimensional case</b><br/>
       I will consider the critical Brezis–Nirenberg problem on bounded
       domains. It is well known that existence and multiplicity of positive
       and sign-changing solutions to this equation is strictly affected by the
       geometry of the domain and the dimension of the euclidean space where
       the domain lies. In particular I will discuss the existence of
       blowing-up solutions to this problem which concentrate on the boundary.

       <b>Long term behaviour: From particle dynamics through kinetic equations to fractional diffusion equations</b><br/>
       The derivation of continuum equations from a discrete deterministic system of
       particles is of major interest. This is an area of research in mathematical
       physics originating from Hilbert's Sixth Problem in 1900. This problem has been
       approached in two steps using the Boltzmann equation as a mesoscopic
       description. The first one is to derive kinetic equations, such as the
       Boltzmann equation, from a system of particles and the second is to derive
       continuum equations, such as Navier–Stokes and Euler equations, from the
       Boltzmann equation. Our work is aiming at deriving (fractional) diffusive
       behaviour from particle models, which can be split in two separate questions.
       The first one is to derive linear Boltzmann equations from a Rayleigh gas
       particle system with a fat-tailed background in a suitable limit of many small
       particles. As a second one is the derivation of diffusive behaviour of linear
       Boltzmann equations by a scaling limit.

      <b>Steklov eigenvalues of negatively curved manifolds</b><br/>
      The geometry and topology of negatively curved manifolds are subtly
      reflected in a geometric bound for the Laplace eigenvalues, a connection
      that has been explored since the 1980s. Among these results, we can
      mention the celebrated result of Schone in 1982 on the Laplace spectral
      gap on closed negatively curved manifolds of dimension at least three.
      Building upon these foundational studies in the Laplace case, we study
      the Steklov eigenvalues of pinched negatively curved manifolds with
      totally geodesic boundaries. The Steklov eigenvalues are associated with
      a first-order elliptic pseudodifferential operator known as the
      Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator.  We discuss a counterpart of Schone's
      result for the Steklov problem on negatively curved manifolds of
      dimension at least three. This talk is based on joint work with Ara
      Basmajian, Jade Brisson, and Antoine Métras.
