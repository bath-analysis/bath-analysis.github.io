      <b>Alexandrov Immersed Mean Curvature Flow</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        In this talk I will introduce Alexandrov immersed mean curvature flow and extend Andrew’s 
        non-collapsing estimate to include Alexandrov immersed surfaces. This estimate implies an
        all-important gradient estimate for the flow and allows mean curvature flow with surgery to
        be extended beyond flows of embedded surfaces to the Alexandrov immersed case. This is joint
        work with Elena Maeder-Baumdicker.

      <b>The essential numerical range for differential operators</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        The essential numerical range is a useful concept to describe spectral pollution
        when approximating a linear operator by projection or domain truncation methods. 
        In this talk I will first give an introduction to the topic and then present some 
        new results for differential operators for which a modified definition gives tighter
        bounds on the set of spectral pollution.
        This is joint work with Marco Marletta (Cardiff) and Christiane Tretter (Bern).

        <b>Exponential mixing with random cellular flows via hypocoercivity</b><br/>
         <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
           In this work we study the evolution of a passive scalar advected by a cellular flow on a
           two-dimensional periodic box, where the centre of the flow undergoes a random walk. We
           prove exponential decay of correlations for mean-free $H^s$ functions, uniformly in 
           diffusivity, leading to almost sure exponential mixing and optimal enhanced dissipation 
           rates. Despite the stochastic nature of the flow, our approach is entirely analytical. We 
           introduce a PDE for the expectation of the two-point process and establish its 
           hypocoercivity in a weighted $H^1$ norm that degenerates at the diagonal. We prove that 
           hypocoercivity of the two-point PDE works as an $L^2$-analogue of geometric ergodicity of 
           the two-point chain in the random dynamical systems framework. This is a joint work with 
           Christian Seis, Univeristät Münster.

      <b>Critical norm blow-up for the energy supercritical nonlinear heat equation</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        We study the behavior of the scaling critical Lebesgue norm for blow-up solutions to
        the nonlinear heat equation (the Fujita equation). For the energy supercritical 
        nonlinearity, we show that the critical norm also blows up at the blow-up time. Moreover,
        we give estimates of the blow-up rate for the critical norm. This is based on joint 
        works with Tobias Barker (University of Bath) and Hideyuki Miura (Institute of Science Tokyo).

      <b>Analysis and Numerics for Open Wave-guides</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        Standard models for opto-electronic/photonic devices often involve
        wave-guides in dielectric media delineated by changes in the refractive
        index, but without a hard boundary. Such devices, called open
        wave-guides, are difficult to analyze and simulate because they
        typically extend to infinity, with perturbations that are not compactly
        supported. I will describe a new approach to solving this class of
        problems that reduces the scattering problem to a transmission problem
        across an infinite artificial interface, and then to a Fredholm system
        of integral equations on the interface. The infinite extent of the
        perturbations requires new types of radiation conditions in order to
        uniquely specify a solution, which I will explain. Finally, the method
        has been numerically implemented in a range of interesting cases by
        Tristan Goodwill, Shidong Jiang, Manas Rachh and Jeremy Hoskins. If
        time permits, I will explain how this is accomplished.

      <b>Shock Reflection and other 2D Riemann Problems in Gas Dynamics</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        The Riemann problem is the IVP having simple piecewise constant initial data
        that is invariant under scaling. In 1D, the problem was originally considered 
        by Riemann during the 19th century in the context of gas dynamics, and the 
        general theory was more or less completed by Lax and Glimm in the mid-20th century.
        In 2D and MD, the situation is much more complicated, and very few analytic results
        are available. We discuss a shock reflection problem for the Euler equations for 
        potential flow, with initial data that generates four interacting shockwaves. 
        After reformulating the problem as a free boundary problem for a nonlinear PDE 
        of mixed hyperbolic-elliptic type, the problem is solved via a sophisticated 
        iteration procedure. The talk is based on joint work with G-Q Chen (Oxford) 
        et. al. arXiv:2305.15224.

      <b>Local minimisers in higher order Calculus of Variations in $L^\infty$: existence, uniqueness and characterisation</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        Higher order problems are very novel in the Calculus of Variations in $L^\infty$, and exhibit a strikingly 
        different behaviour compared to first order problems, for which there exists an established theory, 
        pioneered by Aronsson in 1960s. In this talk I will discuss how a complete theory can be developed for 
        second order functionals. Under appropriate conditions, “localised” minimisers can be characterised as 
        solutions to a nonlinear system of PDEs, which is different from the corresponding Aronsson equation;
        the latter is only a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for minimality. I will also discuss the
        existence and uniqueness of localised minimisers subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, and also their
        partial regularity outside a singular set of codimension one, which may be non-empty even in 1D. The talk 
        will not assume any previous knowledge on the topic, and is based on recent work (arXiv:2403.12625v1) with Roger Moser.

      <b>The Stein-log-Sobolev inequality and the exponential rate of convergence for the continuous Stein variational gradient descent method</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        The Stein Variational Gradient Descent method is a variational inference method in statistics that has recently
        received a lot of attention. The method provides a~deterministic approximation of the target distribution, by introducing
        a nonlocal interaction with a kernel. Despite the significant interest, the exponential rate of convergence for the 
        continuous method has remained an open problem, due to the difficulty of establishing the related so-called Stein-log-Sobolev
        inequality. Here, we prove that the inequality is satisfied for each space dimension and every kernel whose Fourier transform
        has a quadratic decay at infinity and is locally bounded away from zero and infinity. Moreover, we construct weak solutions to
        the related PDE satisfying exponential rate of decay towards the equilibrium. The main novelty in our approach is to interpret
        the Stein-Fisher information as a duality pairing between $H^{-1}$ and $H^{1}$, which allows us to employ the Fourier transform.
        We also provide several examples of kernels for which the Stein-log-Sobolev inequality fails, partially showing the necessity
        of our assumptions. This is a joint work with J. A. Carrillo and J. Warnett.

      <b>Global regularity for critical SQG in bounded domains</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        The critical SQG (surface quasi-geostrophic) equation is widely studied
        in relation to rapid formation of small scales in fluids. In the whole
        space or on the torus, this dissipative  equation has been shown to
        have global smooth solutions some fifteen years ago by
        Caffarelli–Vasseur and, independently, by Kiselev–Nazarov–Volberg.
      </p><p>
        The problem of existence and uniqueness of global smooth solution in
        bounded domains remained open until now. I will present a proof of
        global regularity obtained recently with Ignatova and Q-H. Nguyen. We
        introduce a new methodology of transforming the single nonlocal
        nonlinear evolution equation in a bounded domain into an interacting
        system of extended nonlocal nonlinear evolution equations in the whole
        space. The proof uses the method of the nonlinear maximum principle for
        nonlocal operators in the extended system.

      <b>$L^1$-relaxed area of multivortex maps</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstract</summary><p>
        Relaxation of the Cartesian area functional allows to extend in a natural
        way the area of a graph to non smooth maps. The use of $L^1$-topology in 
        the relaxation has been very successful for scalar valued functions
        mainly for coercivity reasons. However, in the vectorial case, an integral
        representation of the $L^1$-relaxed functional is not possible since,
        as suggested by De Giorgi and proven by Acerbi and Dal Maso in the '90s,
        the subadditivity property is very frequently lost, even in very simple
        cases, e.g. for the vortex map. 
       </p><p>
        In this talk, we will treat the case of multivortex maps: interestingly, 
        whether there is an integral representation will depend not only on the
        distance between the vortices and from the boundary (as already expected),
        but also on the sign of their topological degree.

      <b>Studying nonlinear eigenvalue problems in L-infinity with convex analysis</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        We study a nonlinear eigenvalue problem associated with the Rayleigh quotient $|u|_{\mathrm{Lip}}/|u|_C$,
        where $|u|_{\mathrm{Lip}}$ is the Lipschitz constant of a function $u$ defined on a bounded domain in $\mathbb R^n$
        and $|u|_C$ is its supremum norm. The problem of minimising this Rayleigh quotient is closely 
        related to the infinity Laplacian: minimisers include infinity-harmonic potentials and 
        so-called infinity ground states defined as solutions of a certain limiting PDE obtained by
        taking the limit $p\to \infty$ in the $p$-Laplace eigenvalue problem. Another notable minimiser is 
        the distance function to the boundary of the domain. Unlike existing literature that studies
        $L^\infty$ problems as limits of $L^p$ problems, we study the limiting problem directly using 
        tools from convex analysis. This allows us to obtain results that hold for <em>all</em> minimisers 
        of the Rayleigh quotient. We obtain optimality conditions in form of a divergence PDE using a 
        novel characterisation of the subdifferential of the Lipschitz seminorm $u \mapsto |u|_{\mathrm{Lip}}$ as a 
        functional on $C$. We also study a minimisation problem for the dual Rayleigh quotient involving
        Radon measures and a variant of the Kantorovich–Rubinstein norm, and relate minimisers of the 
        $L^\infty$ Rayleigh quotient to solutions of an optimal transport problem.

      <b>Fluctuations around the mean-field limit for attractive Riesz interaction kernels in the moderate regime</b><br/>
      <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
        In this talk I will give a short introduction to moderately interacting particle systems
        and the general notion of fluctuations around the mean-field limit. We will see how a 
        central limit theorem can be shown for moderately interacting particles on the whole space
        for certain types of interaction potentials. The interaction potential approximates singular
        attractive potentials of sub-Coulomb type and we can show that the fluctuations become
        asymptotically Gaussians. The methodology is inspired by the classical work of Oelschläger 
        in the 1980s on fluctuations for the porous-medium equation. To allow for attractive 
        potentials we use a new approach of quantitative mean-field convergence in probability in 
        order to include aggregation effects. This is joint work with Ansgar Jüngel (TU Wien) and 
        Li Chen (University of Mannheim).

        <b>Mathematical analysis of vorticity fronts</b><br/>
         <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
            We consider a two-dimensional, two-layer, incompressible, steady flow, with vorticity 
           which is constant in each layer, in an infinite channel with rigid walls. The velocity 
           is continuous across the interface, there is no surface tension or difference in density
           between the two layers, and the flow is inviscid. Unlike in previous studies, we consider
           solutions which are localised perturbations rather than periodic or quasi-periodic 
           perturbations of a background shear flow. We rigorously construct a curve of exact
           solutions and give the leading order terms in an asymptotic expansion. We also give
           a thorough qualitative description of the fluid particle paths, which can include
           stagnation points, critical layers, and streamlines which meet the boundary.
           We also construct large amplitudes in the periodic case using global bifurcation techniques.
           These results are corroborated by numerical solutions.

        <b>Minimisation of the Dirichlet Energy amongst a class of constrained maps</b><br/>
          <details><summary>Show abstact</summary><p>
            In this talk, we will consider the problem of minimising the Dirichlet energy 
            \[ \mathbb D(v) = \int_\Omega |\nabla v|^2\, \mathrm dx \]
            subject to a pointwise Jacobian constraint
            \[ \det \nabla v = \det \nabla u \qquad \text{a.e.} \]
            with Dirichlet boundary condition $v|_{\partial\Omega} = u|_{\partial\Omega}$. 
            Both the Dirichlet energy and pointwise Jacobian constraints appear in a wide range of physical problems,
            such as elasticity, which we will briefly discuss.
            This talk will focus on one particuar method for showing that $u$ is a minimiser, which makes use of a so-called excess functional,
            taking the form
            \[ \mathbb E_{\mathsf p}(\varphi) = \int_\Omega |\nabla\varphi|^2 + \mathsf p \det \nabla \varphi(x)\, \mathrm dx. \]
            This functional is interesting in its own right as it serves as an example of a simple (but non-convex)
            functional that is not always bounded below (depending on the choice of $\mathsf p$) and so the direct
            method may not be of use.
          </p><p>
            The bulk of the talk will focus mainly on results relating to the excess functional, investigating
            qualitative changes that occur as $\mathsf p$ is varied. In particular, we will discuss methods for
            establishing sufficient and necessary conditions for the excess to be bounded below. We will then apply
            these methods to a particular one parameter family of pressure functions, deriving sufficient and necessary
            bounds on the parameter. Time allowing, we will then derive the maps $u$, associated with these pressure
            functions $\mathsf p$, that minimize the Dirichlet energy suject to a pointwise Jacobian constraint.
