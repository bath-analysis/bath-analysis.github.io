          <b>Generalised vectorial infinity-eigenvalue problems</b><br/>
          In this talk I will discuss some recent progress made in the study of
          nonlinear eigenvalue problems for supremal functionals. The results
          apply to the quasiconvex vectorial case, but they are new even for
          the scalar case of the well-known infinity-eigenvalue problem.

          I will present an elementary introduction to the regularity and
          uniqueness problems for the Navier-Stokes equations. Thanks to the
          convex integration technique, the h-principle is starting to take
          shape for the uniqueness problem. It might be possible that classical
          scaling invariant uniqueness results (Prodi-Serrin type conditions)
          are the only constraints for constructing non-unique solutions of the
          NSE. As for the regularity problem, the situation is more delicate
          since there are also dynamical constraints that can potentially
          prevent singularity formation.

          <b>A nonlocal isoperimetric problem: density perimeter</b></br>
          We will discuss a variant of a classical geometric minimization
          problem, known as the “nonlocal isoperimetric problem”, which arises
          from studies in Nuclear Physics by Gamow in the 1930’s. By
          introducing a density in the perimeter functional, we obtain features
          that differ substantially from existing results in the framework of
          the classical problem without densities. In the regime of “small”
          non-local contribution, we completely characterize the minimizer, in
          the case the density is a monomial radial weight. This work is a
          collaboration with Stan Alama and Lia Bronsard (McMaster University)
          and Ihsan Topaloglu (Virginia Commonwealth University), as part of
          the project QUALITATIVE PROPERTIES OF WEIGHTED AND ANISOTROPIC

          <b>On the compensated compactness method for concentration effects</b></br>
          We study compensation phenomena for fields satisfying both a
          pointwise and a linear differential constraint. The compensation
          effect takes the form of nonlinear elliptic estimates, where
          constraining the values of the field to lie in a cone compensates for
          the lack of ellipticity of the differential operator. We give a
          series of new examples of this phenomenon, focusing on the case where
          the cone is a subset of the space of symmetric matrices and the
          differential operator is the divergence or the curl. One of our main
          findings is that the maximal gain of integrability is tied to both
          the differential operator and the cone, contradicting in particular a
          recent conjecture of G. De Philippis et al from <a
              href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03077">arXiv:2106.03077</a>.
          This appends the classical compensated compactness framework for
          oscillations with a variant designed for concentrations and also
          extends the recent theory of compensated integrability due to D.
          Serre. In particular, we find a new family of integrands that are
          Div-quasiconcave under convex constraints. Some of our proofs draw
          from a class of degenerate fully nonlinear elliptic equations, the
          \(k\)-hessian equations.

          <b>Stability from rigidity via umbilicity</b></br>
          The soap bubble theorem says that a closed, embedded surface of the
          Euclidean space with constant mean curvature must be a round sphere.
          Especially in real-life problems it is of importance whether and to
          what extent this phenomenon is stable, i.e. when a surface with
          almost constant mean curvature is close to a sphere. This problem has
          been receiving lots of attention until today, with satisfactory
          recent solutions due to Magnanini/Poggesi and Ciraolo/Vezzoni.
          
          The purpose of this talk is to discuss further problems of this type
          and to provide two approaches to their solutions. The first one is a
          new general approach based on stability of the so-called
          "Nabelpunktsatz". The second one is of variational nature and employs
          the theory of curvature flows.

          a paradigm model for multi-mode quantum graphs, and review some of
          its surprising spectral features by addressing it using a scattering
          approach. One familiar with this approach we use it in order to
          investigate a variation on the same theme – where the delta potential
          is periodic along the \(x\) axis.
          \[ 
              H(x,y) = -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} 
              + \frac 12 \Big(-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + y^2\Big)

          parameter \(L\) will be displayed and discussed qualitatively using a
          semi-classical model.

          <b>From individual-based models to continuum descriptions: Modelling and analysis of interactions between different populations</b></br>
          First we will show that the continuum counterpart of the discrete
          individual-based mechanical model that describes the dynamics of two
          contiguous cell populations is given by a free-boundary problem for
          the cell densities.  Then, in addition to interactions, we will
          consider the microscopic movement of cells and derive a fractional
          cross-diffusion system as the many-particle limit of a multi-species
          system of moderately interacting particles.

          <b>Rough solutions of the \(3\)-D compressible Euler equations</b></br>
          I will talk about my work on the compressible Euler equations. We
          prove the local-in-time existence the solution of the compressible
          Euler equations in \(3\)-D, for the Cauchy data of the velocity,
          density and vorticity \((v,\varrho, \omega) \in H^s\times H^s\times
          H^{s'}\), \(2 &lt; s' &lt; s\).  The result extends the sharp result
          of Smith–Tataru and Wang, established in the irrotational case, i.e.
          \(\omega=0\), which is known to be optimal for \(s &gt; 2\). At the
          opposite extreme, in the incompressible case, i.e. with a constant
          density,  the result is known to  hold for \(\omega\in H^s\),
          \(s&gt;3/2\) and fails for \(s\le 3/2\), see the work of Bourgain–Li.
          It is thus natural to conjecture that the optimal result should be
          \((v,\varrho, \omega) \in H^s\times H^s\times H^{s'}\), \(s&gt;2, \,
          s'&gt;\frac{3}{2}\). We view our work as an important step in proving
          the conjecture. The main difficulty in establishing sharp
          well-posedness results for general compressible Euler flow is due to
          the highly nontrivial interaction between the sound waves, governed
          by quasilinear wave equations, and vorticity which is transported by
          the flow. To overcome this difficulty, we separate the dispersive
          part of sound wave from the transported part, and gain regularity
          significantly by exploiting the nonlinear structure of the system and
          the geometric structures of the acoustic spacetime.

          difficulties that arise in the three-dimensional problem that are not
          present in two dimensions. In particular if we omit the common
          assumption that the solutions are irrotational. The rest of the talk

          problem where the vorticity is nonzero. In both we assume that the
          velocity field is Beltrami. In the first result we consider the
          classical water wave problem with surface waves over a body of water.
          In the second result we also consider internal waves between
          different fluids. This talk is based on joint work with Erik Wahlén
          (Lund University) and Evgeniy Lokharu (Lund University).

          <b>Unraveling X-ray transforms on Heisenberg groups</b> <br/>
          The classical X-ray Transform maps a function on Euclidean space to a function
          on the space of lines on this Euclidean space by integrating the function over
          the given line. Inverting the X-ray transform has wide-ranging applications,
          including to medical imaging and seismology. Much work has been done to
          understand this inverse problem in Euclidean space, Euclidean domains, and more
          generally, for symmetric spaces and Riemannian manifolds with boundary where
          the lines become geodesics. We formulate a sub-Riemannian version of the X-ray
          transform on the simplest sub-Riemannnian manifold, the Heisenberg group. Here
          serious geometric obstructions to classical inverse problems, such as existence
          of conjugate points, appear generically. With tools adapted to the geometry,
          such as an operator-valued Fourier Slice Theorem, we prove that an integrable
          function on the Heisenberg group is indeed determined by its line integrals
          over sub-Riemannian (as well as over its compatible Riemannian and Lorentzian)
          geodesics.
          <br/><br/>
          We also pose an abundance of accessible follow-up questions, standard
          in the inverse problems community, concerning the sub-Riemannian
          case, and report progress answering some of them.

          <b>On the existence of spatially tempered null solutions to linear constant coefficient PDEs</b><br/>
          Given a linear, constant coefficient partial differential equation in
          \(\mathbb R^{d+1}\), where one independent variable plays the role of ‘time’, a
          distributional solution is called a null solution if its past is
          zero. Motivated by physical considerations, we consider
          distributional solutions that are tempered in the spatial directions
          alone (and do not impose any restriction in the time direction).
          Considering such spatially tempered distributional solutions, we give

          <b>Quasi-invariance and growth of Sobolev norms for Hamiltonian PDEs</b>
          <p>
          In this talk, we consider a Hamiltonian PDE with a suitable gaussian
          initial data, with the goal of studying the growth in time of the
          solution to this equation.
          </p><p>
          The study of this kind of problems was started by Bourgain in ’96,
          who considered the Schrödinger equation with cubic nonlinearity posed
          on the 2-dimensional torus (2d-NLS). In his work, Bourgain exploited
          the formal invariance of the Gibbs measure in order to construct
          solutions to 2d-NLS in negative Sobolev regularity. These solutions
          satisfy a logarithmic bound on the growth of their norm.
          </p><p>
          A crucial observation is that Bourgain’s argument relies only on
          quasi-invariance, i.e. the existence of a density for the law of the
          solution with respect to the initial gaussian measure, together with
          some assumptions on the density.
          </p><p>
          In 2015, N. Tzvetkov developed a strategy to prove quasi-invariance
          that depends only on the structure of the transport equation
          associated with the flow. This approach was expanded in 2018 by
          Planchon, Tzvetkov and Visciglia, who managed to incorporate some
          information about the solution that come from the deterministic study
          of the PDE. This allows to obtain quasi-invariance as a consequence
          of deterministic global well posedness in a plethora of situations.
          </p><p>
          In this talk, we suggest a further improvement to the previous
          techniques, that relies on finer space-time properties of the density
          of the transported measure. As an application, we obtain
          quasi-invariance and polynomial growth of solutions for the
          fourth-order Schrödinger equation with initial data in negative
          Sobolev regularity.

          <b>A quantitative approach to the Navier–Stokes equations</b><br/>
          Recently, Terence Tao used a new quantitative approach to infer that
          certain ‘slightly supercritical’ quantities for the Navier–Stokes
          equations must become unbounded near a potential blow-up time. In
          this talk I’ll discuss a new strategy for proving quantitative bounds
          for the Navier–Stokes equations, as well as applications to
          behaviours of potentially singular solutions.  This talk is based
          upon joint work with Christophe Prange (CNRS, Cergy Paris
          Université).

          <b>Long-time behaviour in the 2D Euler-Boussinesq equations near a stably stratified Couette flow</b> <br/>
          Fluids in the ocean are often inhomogeneous, incompressible and, in
          relevant physical regimes, can be described by the 2D
          Euler–Boussinesq system. Equilibrium states are then commonly
          observed to be stably stratified, namely the density increases with
          depth. We are interested in considering the case when also a
          background shear flow is present. In the talk, I will describe
          quantitative results for small perturbations around a stably
          stratified Couette flow. We show that the density variation and
          velocity decay in \(L^2\) with a rate \(O(t^{-1/2})\), namely they undergo
          inviscid damping. On the other hand, the vorticity and density
          gradient grow as \(O(t^{1/2})\), a phenomenon that we call shear-buoyancy
          instability. This is first precisely quantified at the linear level.
          For the nonlinear problem, the result holds on the optimal time-scale
          on which a perturbative regime can be considered. Namely, given an
          initial perturbation of size \(O(ε)\), thanks to the linear instability,
          it becomes of size \(O(1)\) on a time-scale of order \(O(ε^{-2})\). This is
          joint work with J. Bedrossian, R. Bianchini and M. Coti Zelati.

          <b>Rigorous Continuum Limit for the Discrete Network Formation Problem</b> <br/>
          Motivated by recent physics papers describing the formation of
          biological transport networks we study a discrete model proposed by
          Hu and Cai consisting of an energy consumption function constrained
          by a linear system on a graph. We study the existence of solutions to
          this model, propose an adaptation so that a macroscopic system can be
          obtained as its formal continuum limit, and show the global existence
          of weak solutions of the macroscopic gradient flow. For the spatially
          two-dimensional rectangular setting we prove the rigorous continuum
          limit of the constrained energy functional as the number of nodes of
          the underlying graph tends to infinity and the edge lengths shrink to
          zero uniformly. This is joint work with J. Haskovec and P. Markowich.

          <b>Existence of hypersurfaces with prescribed-mean-curvature</b><br/>
          Let \(N\) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension 3 or higher,
          and \(g\) a Lipschitz non-negative (or non-positive) function on \(N\). We
          prove that there exists a closed hypersurface \(M\) whose mean curvature
          attains the values prescribed by \(g\) (joint work with Neshan Wickramasekera,
          Cambridge). Except possibly for a small singular set (of codimension 7 or
          higher), the hypersurface \(M\) is \(C^2\) immersed and two-sided (it admits a
          global unit normal); the scalar mean curvature at \(x\) is \(g(x)\) with
          respect to a global choice of unit normal. More precisely, the immersion is a
          quasi-embedding, namely the only non-embedded points are caused by tangential
          self-intersections: around such a non-embedded point, the local structure is
          given by two disks, lying on one side of each other, and intersecting
          tangentially (as in the case of two spherical caps touching at a point). A
          special case of PMC (prescribed-mean-curvature) hypersurfaces is obtained when
          \(g\) is a constant, in which the above result gives a CMC
          (constant-mean-curvature) hypersurface for any prescribed value of the mean
          curvature. The construction of \(M\) is carried out largely by means of PDE
          principles: (i) a minmax for an Allen–Cahn (or Modica-Mortola) energy,
          involving a parameter that, when sent to 0, leads to an interface from which
          the desired PMC hypersurface is extracted; (ii) quasi-linear elliptic PDE and
          geometric-measure-theory arguments, to obtain regularity conclusions for said
          interface; (iii) parabolic semi-linear PDE (together with specific features of
          the Allen-Cahn framework), to tackle cancellation phenomena that can happen
          when sending to 0 the Allen-Cahn parameter.

          <b>Oscillation and concentration in sequences of PDE constrained maps</b><br/>
          It is well-known that for exponents \(p&gt;1\), any \(L^p\)-weakly
          converging sequence of PDE constrained maps admits, up to a
          subsequence, a decomposition into sequences of PDE constrained maps
          where one converges in measure (no oscillation) and the other is
          \(p\)-equi-integrable (no concentration). For \(p=1\) the relevant
          corresponding result concerns weakly* convergent sequences of PDE
          constrained measures and is false: the oscillation and concentration
          cannot be separated while simultaneously satisfying the PDE
          constraint. In this talk we explain how the concentration regardless
          of the failure of a decomposition result retains its PDE character.
          The presented results are parts of joint works with Andre Guerra
          (IAS/ETH) and Bogdan Raita (Pisa).

          <b>Fine properties of steady water waves</b><br/>
          In this talk we will discuss some recent results on two dimensional
          steady water waves. We will explain how the Benjamin and Lighthill
          conjecture can be significantly refined and will prove a new bound
          for the amplitude of an arbitrary Stokes wave in terms of the
          non-dimensional Bernoulli constant. Our result, in particular,
          implies the inequality \(a \leq C c^2 / g\), where \(a\) is the
          amplitude, \(c\) is the speed of the wave, and \(g\) is the
          gravitational constant. This fact is valid for arbitrary Stokes waves
          irrespectively of the amplitude with an absolute constant \(C\).
          Another observation is that any extreme Stokes wave over a
          sufficiently deep stream has necessarily a small amplitude, provided
          the non-dimensional mass flux is much smaller than the depth.

          <b>Elasto-plasticity driven by dislocation movement</b><br/>
          The modelling of large-strain elasto-plasticity poses many challenges
          and, despite its great practical importance in industry, no fully
          satisfactory theory has emerged so far. On the other hand, it has
          been known for a long time that the principal mechanism behind
          macroscopic plastic deformation in crystalline materials (such as
          metals) is the movement of dislocations, that is, 1-dimensional
          topological defects in the crystal lattice. In this talk, I will
          present some recent progress towards the challenge of coupling
          elasto-plasticity with the movement of systems of (discrete)
          dislocations. In particular, I will explain how a new geometric
          language, built on 2-dimensional "slip trajectories" in space-time
          (based on the theory of integral currents), yields a natural
          mathematical framework for dislocation evolutions. This yields the
          first existence result for solutions to the evolutionary system
          describing a crystal undergoing large-strain elasto-plastic
          deformations where the plastic part of the deformation is driven
          directly by the movement of dislocations. This is joint work with T.

          <b>From ketchup to concentration-driven convex integration</b><br/>
          It is much easier to make hair gel or shaving foam flow after
          applying some force to it. Such fluid is called non-Newtonian: it
          changes its viscosity under applied force. This behaviour is abundant
          in nature: ketchup, ice, concrete, molten lava, blood, certain
          polymers, porridge, not forgetting the eponymous ketchup are all
          non-Newtonian. A simple model of such fluid (a power-law model) is
          known to be well-posed in the 'subcritical' regime and to have energy
          solutions above its 'compactness threshold'. A recent result obtained
          with S. Modena and L. Székelyhidi shows that also a dual picture
          holds. Namely, the power-law model is ill posed below the
          'compactness threshold' and it has many (very) weak solutions in the
          'supercritical regime'. The last result is of consequence to the
          classical Navier–Stokes equations.
